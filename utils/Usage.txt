Download latest library LWJGL (3.3.2 at this time) from:
https://www.lwjgl.org/customize

Put MoveAllFiles.bat inside the directory with downloaded & extracted zip content.
Run MoveAllFiles.bat and wait brief amount of time (less than 3 seconds) to sort out the files under directories.
Rest unsorted put into classpath directory.

In Apache NetBeans IDE 16 (or later) create new library
by specifying classpath, sources & javadocs in that order.

Add library to the project.

Done.
